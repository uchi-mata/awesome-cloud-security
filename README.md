# Awesome Cloud Security Resources

Welcome to my collection of Cloud Security Resources! While the term "Cloud" might not be entirely accurate here, I've used it as a broad umbrella for anything remotely cloud-related such as container or even DevSecOps (and maybe even wilder stuff in the future ðŸ™‚). 

This repository includes resources spanning foundational concepts to advanced, niche topics. It is not meant to be comprehensive but reflects what I found worth saving at a given time. You might notice that some widely known tools or techniques are absent; that's because they're popular enough that I didnâ€™t feel the need to include them. Conversely, some seemingly obvious entries might be here because they were novel or less common when I encountered them. 

Please note that I havenâ€™t exhaustively reviewed all the links or projects before sharing this collection. Some may no longer exist, but I chose to include them as they capture moments in my learning journey. I hope they inspire your own explorationsâ€”or perhaps spark a bit of nostalgia.
